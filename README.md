# PixelWeatherOS Lite
This is an alternative implementation of [PixelWeatherOS](https://github.com/PixelWeatherProject/pwos/) in MicroPython **for comparison purposes** only. It will not be actively developed.

For details see the original version in Rust linked above.

## Installation
You can install this using [`rshell`](https://github.com/dhylands/rshell).

Assuming you're in the root of this repo, you can use *rshell*'s `rsync -m . /pyboard` command to transfer all the scripts to flash.
